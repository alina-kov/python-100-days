# Python 100 Days of Code

This repository contains selected practice projects from the  
**"100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp"** course by Angela Yu.

The goal of this repository is to track my learning progress and showcase
some of the exercises and small projects I complete while studying Python.

Not all course assignments are included here — only selected projects
that I consider useful for practice or demonstration.

Example:
- `Day 18 Turtle and GUI / hirst_project` — Hirst-style dot painting using Python Turtle

## Technologies used

## Status
🚧 In progress — currently working through the course.
